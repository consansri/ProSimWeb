/**
 * ELF Section Header
 *
 * @param sh_name This member specifies the name of the section. Its value is an index into
 * the section header string table section [see "String Table'' below], giving
 * the location of a null-terminated string.
 *
 * @param sh_type This member categorizes the section's contents and semantics.
 *
 * @param sh_flags Sections support 1-bit flags that describe miscellaneous attributes.
 *
 * @param sh_addr If the section will appear in the memory image of a process, this member
 * gives the address at which the section's first byte should reside. Otherwise,
 * the member contains 0.
 *
 * @param sh_offset This member's value gives the byte offset from the beginning of the file to
 * the first byte in the section. One section type, SHT_NOBITS described
 * below, occupies no space in the file, and its sh_offset member locates
 * the conceptual placement in the file.
 *
 * @param sh_size This member gives the section's size in bytes.  Unless the section type is
 * SHT_NOBITS, the section occupies sh_size bytes in the file. A section
 * of type SHT_NOBITS may have a non-zero size, but it occupies no space
 * in the file.
 *
 * @param sh_link This member holds a section header table index link, whose interpretation
 * depends on the section type. If not defined/used then its default value is [SHN_UNDEF].
 *
 * @param sh_info This member holds extra information, whose interpretation depends on the
 * section type. If not defined/used then its default value is [UInt32.ZERO].
 *
 * @param sh_addralign Some sections have address alignment constraints. For example, if a section
 * holds a doubleword, the system must ensure doubleword alignment for the
 * entire section.  That is, the value of sh_addr must be congruent to 0,
 * modulo the value of sh_addralign. Currently, only 0 and positive
 * integral powers of two are allowed. Values 0 and 1 mean the section has no
 * alignment constraints.
 *
 * @param sh_entsize Some sections hold a table of fixed-size entries, such as a symbol table. For
 * such a section, this member gives the size in bytes of each entry. The
 * member contains 0 if the section does not hold a table of fixed-size entries.
